/**
 * This project is a text-based adventure game framework.
 *
 * <p>The project is designed to allow multiple developers to add their own rooms and
 * interactions within a shared game environment. The main components of the project include:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>RoomInitializer:</b> A utility class responsible for initializing all rooms in the game.
 *   <li><b>StartRoom:</b> An example room implementation that serves as the starting point of the game.
 *   <li><b>build.xml:</b> An ANT build file for compiling and packaging the project.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Developers are encouraged to add their own room implementations by following the
 * guidelines provided in the `RoomInitializer` class. Each room should be added using
 * its Fully Qualified Name (FQN) to avoid merge conflicts.</p>
 *
 * <p><b>See the README.md file in the project directory more information.</b></p>
