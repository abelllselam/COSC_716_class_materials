 * Simple exception for Unknown Commands.

 * This may be abusing exceptions a bit, as the player is often going to enter invalid
 * commands (rather than it being a true "exceptional case"). However, given that there is
 * no way to predict what a user might enter, an exception allows for easier handling of
 * an invalid command regardless of where in the parsing chain the problem is discovered.
