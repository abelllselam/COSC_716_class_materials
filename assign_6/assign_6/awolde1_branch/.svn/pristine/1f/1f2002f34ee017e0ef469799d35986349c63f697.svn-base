This is a text-based adventure game "shell" where new items and rooms can be added and modified as
the course progresses.

* Please note that the code in the `core` package of the game should ***NOT*** be modified!
  Instead, new classes should be added to the `world` package to add new functionality.


* This code ***requires*** `Java\JDK 21` or higher to compile and run.


* All Code additions should have a source-level of `21` or lower.
    * Java/JDK 21 is available for download from many locations. Personally, I recommend any of the
      following:
        * [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
        * [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#downloads-table-zulu)
        * [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)


* The SVN repository for this project is located at:  
  `svn://cosc436.net:65436/Game/XXX/trunk` (where 'XXX' is section number of the course).\
  For *example*, section `001` would use: `svn://cosc436.net:65436/Game/001/trunk`


* The repository is organized as follows:
    * `.../trunk` - the main development branch
    * `.../branches` - a directory containing branches for each student
    * `.../tags` - a directory containing tags for each assignment
