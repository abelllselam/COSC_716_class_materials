**What Is a Design Pattern?**

# Definition

- A design pattern is a reusable solution to a common software design problem. It’s not code you copy–paste, but a template describing:
- Intent: What problem it solves and why you’d use it.
- Structure: The key participants (classes or objects) and their relationships.
- Collaboration: How they interact at runtime.

# Benefits

- Proven: Patterns come from years of experience.
- Communicative: You can say “use Observer” and everyone knows the gist.
- Maintainable: They help keep code flexible and decoupled.

# Three Main Categories

| Category   | Purpose                                          | Examples                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Creational | Control object **creation**,hide complexity      | Singleton,Factory Method, Builder |
| Structural | Define **relationships** between classes/objects | Adapter, Decorator, Proxy         |
| Behavioral | Manage **communication** and **algorithms**      | Observer, Strategy, Command       |
